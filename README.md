# SD Exam 2021 - Music Webshop
## Installing and running the application
In order to run this application, you must first run the chinook_abridged.sql sql script.
Then, you'll need to place the root folder in a htdocs folder in an Apache server.
After running the Apache server, you'll be able to enter the application via the url: 'http://localhost/*Folder-name*/views/login.php'. For example, if your root folder is named music, the url will be: 'http://localhost/music/views/login.php'.

## API Endpoints
For the next part, we assume the root name of the application folder is music, meaning we'll be using the url 'http://localhost/music/' as the base url for the API endpoints. For example, getting a track by track id, will work using the following url: http://localhost/music/tracks/{id} <br/>
All actions, except the login endpoint, requires you to be logged in. Some requires you to be logged in as admin. If admin login is requires, it is specified. <br/>
Trying to access non-existing endpoints will result in 404.
